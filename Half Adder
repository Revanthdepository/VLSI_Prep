Half Adder Explained in Technical Terms:
A half adder is a fundamental building block in digital circuits that performs the addition of two single-bit binary numbers. It has two inputs, A and B, and two outputs, Sum (S) and Carry (C).

Functionality:

The Sum (S) output represents the least significant bit (LSB) of the binary addition result.
The Carry (C) output indicates whether there was a carry-over from adding the two input bits. This carry bit will be used in subsequent additions for multi-bit numbers.

Implementation:
The half adder can be implemented with two basic logic gates:

XOR gate performs an exclusive OR operation on the two input bits (A and B). The output of the XOR gate is:
1: If the input bits are different (one is 0 and the other is 1)
0: If the input bits are the same (both 0 or both 1)
AND gate: This gate performs an AND operation on the two input bits. The output of the AND gate is:
1: If both input bits are 1
0: Otherwise
Truth Table:

A	B 	Sum (S)	Carry (C)
0	0	    0     0
0	1	    1	    0
1	0	    1	    0
1	1	    0	    1

Limitations:
The half-adder can only add two single-bit binary numbers.
It cannot handle carry-in from previous additions, limiting its use for multi-bit addition.

Applications:
Half adders are used as building blocks for full adders, which can handle carry-in and enable multi-bit addition.
They are also used in various digital circuits, such as encoders, decoders, and arithmetic logic units (ALUs).
